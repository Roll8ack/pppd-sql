Introduction
============

The first support for any kind of encryption was introduced in version
0.4.0 of 'pppd-sql' and currently it supports the symmetric block ciphers
and one-way hashes below.

Which ciphers and hashes are supported?
=======================================

The list below includes a security level between 1 and 5, where 1 is
lowest and 5 highest security. Please keep in mind, that the choice
of the algorithm isn't the whole job. The key length and especially the
chaining mode for the symmetric ciphers are very important!

  * UNIX crypt() (non-standard DES-56)
    $ glibc extension
      - security level 1
      - PAP support

  * MD5-128
    $ OpenSSL extension
      - security level 3
      - PAP support

  * AES-128-ECB
    $ OpenSSL extension
      - security level 3
      - PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAPv1 and MS-CHAPv2 support

How are the cipher and hases stored?
====================================

Every encrypted data is stored as a hexadecimal number. This format is
used because it can be represented in every database with a simple
VARCHAR field.

The goal of 'pppd-sql' is to support most of the available databases,
without using specific database extensions. The encryption part will be
done completely by OpenSSL.

What are the differences between PAP and CHAP?
==============================================

The passwords for PAP can be stored using a one-way hash inside database,
because if the link should be established the account information is send
in plaintext to the server.

The problem arise with the newer protocol. CHAP is an authentication
scheme used by Point to Point Protocol (PPP) servers to validate the
identity of remote clients by using a three-way handshake. This happens
at the time of establishing the initial link, and may happen again at
any time afterwards. The verification is based on a shared secret (such
as the client user's password).

   1.) After the completion of the link establishment phase, the
       authenticator sends a "challenge" message to the peer.
   2.) The peer responds with a value calculated using a one-way
       hash function, such as an MD5 checksum hash.
   3.) The authenticator checks the response against its own
       calculation of the expected hash value. If the values match,
       the authenticator acknowledges the authentication; otherwise
       it terminates the connection.

A fourth step may happen, but this is not required and won't be made
by every PPP server.

   4.) At random intervals the authenticator sends a new challenge
       to the peer and repeats steps 1 through 3.

CHAP provides protection against playback attack by the peer through the
use of an incrementally changing identifier and of a variable challenge-
value. CHAP requires that both the client and server know the plaintext
of the secret, although it is never sent over the network.

Why should I use encryption?
============================

The answer is simple. This functionality will not increase the security
of PAP or CHAP (MS-CHAPv1 and MS-CHAPv2), but if you have a lot of
accounts and many people with access to your database it will even
secure the storage place. If someone break-in your database, the
passwords are still safe, only the plugin on the PPP server need the
decryption key and if someone break-in there, you have lost regardless
of encryption or not. ;)
