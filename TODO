Features and functionality which should be added in the future.

    * Well no real feature but needs to be done. Testing, testing and
      more testing. Maybe there exist unknown bugs. :)

    * Add support for encrypted Password storage inside database.
      (MD5 or Crypt)

    * Add support for other database backends. (Firebird/InterBase,
      Ingres and SQLite)

    * Add support for authentication fallback against usual files
      '/etc/ppp/pap-secrets' or '/etc/ppp/chap-secrets'.

    * Add 'scripts' directory with database schemas for import.

    * Add switch to specify which database backends should be build.
      Some examples:

        --enable-mysql
        --enable-postgresql

Look at the AUTHORS file if you want help me with 'pppd-sql', or
if you have other interesting features which should be added.
