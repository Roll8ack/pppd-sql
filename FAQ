================================

Q: What is 'pppd-sql'?
A: 'pppd-sql' is a plugin for the Point-to-Point server (pppd)
   which adds PAP and CHAP authentication via a MySQL or PostgreSQL
   database.

Q: What is needed?
A: You need a running PPP Server >= 2.4.4 which allows runtime load
   of plugins. Almost every latest distribution comes with a PPP
   Server which provide this functionality.

Q: Why did you start this project?
A: I was seeking a solution for doing MS-PPTP authentication with
   MySQL for my employer the PlusServer AG.

Q: Why did not extend old 'pppd-mysql' itself?
A: Simple answer: It is a very small project and almost every piece
   of code was rewrittten, so it doesn't make sense. But of course
   it was a great application to learn.

Q: Is it working with MS-CHAPv1 and MS-CHAPv2?
A: Yes it is, this was the main reason for creating this plugin.

Q: I have a cool idea for 'pppd-sql' but don't know C.
A: No problem, i started this utility to enhance the PPP Server
   with some cool features. So look at the authors file and send me
   an email.
